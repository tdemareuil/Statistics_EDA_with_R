# Statistics_homework_maths_R

This is the midterm project in my Statistics class at Ecole Polytechnique (MSc Data Science, 2019-2020).

You will find in this repository the final report I worked on with a classmate ([Charles Cazals](https://github.com/charlescazals)).

It includes mathematics questions in the 1st part (work on the Poisson distribution), and exploratory data analysis with R in the 2nd part (work on the `USJudgeRatings` dataset).
